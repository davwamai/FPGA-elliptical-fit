# FPGA-elliptical-fit
an FPGA approach for finding the best-fit for an elliptical point cloud. Utilizes Fitzgibbon's method and Cardano's method for eigensystem computation.

unfinished skeleton code. just here to give me a place to store my changes and allow me to update from work/home, but cool enough to show off its development.
